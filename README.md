# Music-Predictor-AI
Using Anaconda Navigator i started a local host useing Jupyter Notebook to write this little peice of code to help predict what kind of music a client might like based off their age and gender. The code uses 20% of the user data for testing and 80% for training. You can test the accuracy by typinh score in the concole.
I downloaded two packages to help with the algorithm for this code. One being Pandas and the other being sklearn.
